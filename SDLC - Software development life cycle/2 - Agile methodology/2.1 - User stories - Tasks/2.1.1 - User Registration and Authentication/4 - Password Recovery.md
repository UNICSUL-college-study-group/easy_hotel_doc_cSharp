**As a user**,  
I want to recover my account if I forget my password,  
so that I can regain access to the platform.  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system should display a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page.
- The system should send a password reset link to the user’s registered email.
- The reset link should redirect the user to a form to set a new password.
- After resetting, the user should be able to log in with the new password.

### **Tasks for Password Recovery**

#### **1. Front-End Implementation**

1. **Create the Password Recovery Form**
    
    - Design and implement a React component for the password recovery form.
    - Include an input field for the user to enter their email address.
    - Add a "Send Recovery Email" button for form submission.
2. **Client-Side Validation**
    
    - Validate the email address format before submitting the form.
    - Display an error message for invalid email addresses.
3. **Display Feedback to the User**
    
    - Show a loading spinner or animation when the form is submitted.
    - Display a success message (e.g., "Recovery email sent!") if the request is successful.
    - Display an error message if the server reports an issue (e.g., "Email not found").
4. **Create a Password Reset Form**
    
    - Design and implement a separate React component for setting a new password.
    - Include input fields for:
        - New password
        - Confirm password
    - Add a "Reset Password" button for submission.
5. **Validate Password Inputs**
    
    - Ensure the new password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
    - Verify that the "Confirm Password" matches the "New Password."

#### **2. Back-End Implementation**

1. **Create Password Recovery API Endpoint**
    
    - Develop a C# endpoint (e.g., `/api/password-recovery`) to handle requests for password recovery.
    - Accept the user’s email address as input.
2. **Verify Email Address**
    
    - Check if the provided email exists in the database.
    - If the email does not exist, return an appropriate error response.
3. **Generate a Secure Reset Token**
    
    - Create a unique, time-sensitive token for the password reset (e.g., JWT with an expiration time).
    - Store the token in the database with the associated user’s email and expiration timestamp.
4. **Send Recovery Email**
    
    - Use an email service (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES) to send a recovery email to the user.
    - Include a password reset link in the email (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/reset-password?token=XYZ`).
5. **Create Password Reset API Endpoint**
    
    - Develop a second endpoint (e.g., `/api/reset-password`) to handle password reset requests.
    - Accept the reset token and new password as input.
6. **Validate the Reset Token**
    
    - Check the token against the database for validity and expiration.
    - If valid, allow the user to reset their password.
    - If invalid or expired, return an error response.
7. **Hash and Update the Password**
    
    - Hash the new password using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    - Update the user’s password in the database.

#### **3. Database Adjustments**

1. **Add Password Recovery Table (Optional)**
    
    - Create a table to store password recovery tokens:
        - `TokenID` (Primary Key)
        - `UserID` (Foreign Key)
        - `ResetToken`
        - `ExpirationTime`
2. **Update User Table (Optional)**
    
    - Add a field to store the reset token and expiration directly in the user table:
        - `PasswordResetToken`
        - `PasswordResetExpires`

---

#### **4. Integration**

1. **Connect Front-End to Back-End**
    
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to:
        - Send the email address to `/api/password-recovery` for recovery.
        - Send the reset token and new password to `/api/reset-password`.
2. **Handle Success and Error Responses**
    
    - Show appropriate messages on the front-end based on server responses.

---

#### **5. Security Considerations**

1. **Use HTTPS**
    
    - Ensure all communication between the front-end and back-end is encrypted.
2. **Token Expiration**
    
    - Set a short expiration time for reset tokens (e.g., 1 hour).
3. **Secure Token Generation**
    
    - Use cryptographically secure methods to generate reset tokens.
4. **Rate Limit Requests**
    
    - Implement rate-limiting on the password recovery endpoint to prevent abuse.
5. **Sensitive Information**
    
    - Do not disclose whether an email exists in the system in error messages (e.g., always return a generic response like "If this email exists, a recovery email has been sent").
6. **Prevent Replay Attacks**
    
    - Invalidate the token after a successful password reset.

---

#### **6. Testing**

1. **Unit Testing (Back-End)**
    
    - Test the `/api/password-recovery` and `/api/reset-password` endpoints for:
        - Valid inputs.
        - Invalid or expired tokens.
        - Nonexistent email addresses.
2. **Integration Testing**
    
    - Test the complete flow from requesting a recovery email to resetting the password.
3. **UI Testing**
    
    - Ensure the password recovery and reset forms:
        - Validate inputs.
        - Display proper feedback for success and errors.
4. **Email Testing**
    
    - Verify that the recovery email is sent with the correct reset link.
5. **Load Testing**
    
    - Test the system’s ability to handle multiple concurrent password recovery requests.

---

#### **7. Deployment**

1. **Deploy Password Recovery API**
    
    - Ensure both `/api/password-recovery` and `/api/reset-password` endpoints are live.
2. **Update Front-End**
    
    - Include the password recovery and reset forms in the deployed application.
3. **Monitor Password Recovery Metrics**
    
    - Track recovery requests, token usage, and errors to identify potential issues.
