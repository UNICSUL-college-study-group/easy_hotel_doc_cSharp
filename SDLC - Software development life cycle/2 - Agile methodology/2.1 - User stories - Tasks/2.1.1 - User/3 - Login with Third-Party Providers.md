- **As a user**,  
    I want to log into the platform using my Google or Facebook account,  
    so that I can easily access my profile without creating a new password.  
    
    **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system should display options to log in via Google or Facebook on the login page.
    - After successful authentication, the system should create a new account if the user is logging in for the first time.
    - If the user already exists, the system should link the third-party account to their profile.

### **Tasks for Login with Third-Party Providers**

#### **1. Front-End Implementation**

1. **Update Login Page**
    
    - Add "Login with Google" and "Login with Facebook" buttons to the login page.
    - Style the buttons to match the platform's guidelines (Google's Material Design and Facebook's branding).
2. **Integrate Third-Party SDKs**
    
    - Install and configure the required SDKs or libraries:
        - Google: `@react-oauth/google` or Google's JavaScript SDK.
        - Facebook: Facebook JavaScript SDK.
3. **Handle Authentication Tokens**
    
    - Capture the token or response provided by Google/Facebook after successful login.
    - Send the token to your back-end for validation and account linking.
4. **User Feedback**
    
    - Display a loading spinner or animation while waiting for third-party login responses.
    - Show an error message if the third-party login fails.

#### **2. Back-End Implementation**

1. **Configure Google Login**
    
    - Set up a Google API project in the Google Cloud Console.
    - Enable the "Google Sign-In" API.
    - Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).
    - Create an endpoint (e.g., `/api/auth/google`) to handle the Google login token:
        - Validate the token with Google's OAuth server.
        - Retrieve user information (e.g., email, name) from the token.
2. **Configure Facebook Login**
    
    - Set up a Facebook app in the Facebook Developer Console.
    - Obtain App ID and App Secret.
    - Create an endpoint (e.g., `/api/auth/facebook`) to handle the Facebook login token:
        - Validate the token with Facebook's Graph API.
        - Retrieve user information (e.g., email, name) from the token.
3. **Link Third-Party Accounts**
    
    - Check if the email from the third-party provider matches an existing user in your database.
        - If the user exists, log them in.
        - If the user does not exist, create a new user account with the provided information.
4. **Generate and Return JWT**
    
    - After successful validation, generate a JWT for the user.
    - Return the JWT to the front-end for session management.

#### **3. Database Adjustments**

1. **Extend User Table**
    
    - Add fields to store third-party identifiers:
        - `GoogleID` (nullable)
        - `FacebookID` (nullable)
        - `IsThirdPartyUser` (boolean)
2. **Ensure Unique Constraints**
    
    - Ensure that each third-party identifier is unique in the database.

---

#### **4. Integration**

1. **Connect Front-End to Back-End**
    
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to send Google/Facebook tokens to the respective back-end endpoints.
    - Handle the back-end response:
        - On success: Save the JWT and redirect the user.
        - On failure: Display an error message.
2. **Session Management**
    
    - Store the JWT securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies or localStorage).

---

#### **5. Security Considerations**

1. **Validate Tokens with Providers**
    
    - Always validate Google and Facebook tokens on the server side to prevent spoofing.
2. **Use HTTPS**
    
    - Ensure all communications between the client, back-end, and third-party providers are encrypted.
3. **Rate Limit API Calls**
    
    - Prevent abuse of third-party login endpoints with rate-limiting.
4. **Privacy Compliance**
    
    - Ensure the platform complies with GDPR, CCPA, or other relevant privacy regulations.

---

#### **6. Testing**

1. **Unit Tests (Back-End)**
    
    - Test Google and Facebook token validation endpoints with:
        - Valid tokens.
        - Expired tokens.
        - Invalid tokens.
2. **Integration Tests**
    
    - Test the complete flow:
        - From clicking the login button to receiving a JWT.
        - Handling errors from Google/Facebook APIs.
3. **UI Testing**
    
    - Verify that the "Login with Google" and "Login with Facebook" buttons:
        - Render correctly.
        - Respond to user actions.
        - Display appropriate error/success feedback.
4. **Load Testing**
    
    - Test the ability to handle multiple concurrent third-party login requests.

---

#### **7. Deployment**

1. **Back-End Configuration**
    
    - Deploy the Google and Facebook endpoints to a secure server.
    - Set environment variables for the Client IDs, Secrets, and API keys.
2. **Front-End Configuration**
    
    - Ensure the front-end uses the correct OAuth Client IDs for the production environment.
3. **Monitor Third-Party Logins**
    
    - Track successful and failed logins via Google and Facebook for analytics.
