**As a user**,  
I want to update my account information, such as my name, email, password, or phone number,  
so that I can keep my details accurate and secure.  

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- The system should display a profile page where the user can edit their information.
- The system should validate any changes (e.g., email format, password complexity).
- Changes should be saved only after successful validation.
- For sensitive changes (e.g., email, password), the user should be required to re-enter their current password.

### **Tasks for Update Profile Information**

#### **1. Front-End Implementation**

1. **Design the Profile Update Page**
    
    - Create a React component for the user profile update page.
    - Include input fields for editable user information:
        - Name
        - Email (optional, but may be restricted for some systems)
        - Phone number
        - Password (optional)
    - Add a "Save Changes" button for form submission.
2. **Pre-fill Existing User Data**
    
    - Fetch the current user data from the back-end (e.g., `/api/user/profile`) and pre-fill the form fields.
3. **Client-Side Validation**
    
    - Validate the inputs before submitting the form:
        - Ensure the name is not empty.
        - Validate the phone number format.
        - Ensure the new password (if updated) meets security requirements.
4. **Handle Feedback**
    
    - Show a loading indicator while changes are being saved.
    - Display success or error messages after the request:
        - Success: "Profile updated successfully!"
        - Error: "An error occurred while updating your profile."

#### **2. Back-End Implementation**

1. **Create Profile Retrieval API**
    
    - Develop a C# endpoint (e.g., `/api/user/profile`) to fetch the current user’s profile information.
    - Authenticate the user using the token in the request header.
    - Return user details (excluding sensitive information like passwords).
2. **Create Profile Update API**
    
    - Develop a C# endpoint (e.g., `/api/user/update-profile`) to handle profile update requests.
    - Accept updated fields in the request payload (e.g., `name`, `phone`, `password`).
3. **Authenticate and Authorize Requests**
    
    - Ensure the user is authenticated and authorized to update their own profile.
    - Validate the token provided in the request header.
4. **Validate Inputs**
    
    - Ensure the updated fields follow the required format and constraints:
        - Email (if updatable) should be unique in the database.
        - Password (if updated) should be hashed securely before saving.
5. **Update the Database**
    
    - Update the user record in the database with the new information.
    - If updating the email, send a confirmation email to validate the new email address (optional).
6. **Send Response**
    
    - Return a success response if the update is successful.
    - Handle and return error responses for:
        - Validation failures.
        - Database update issues.

#### **3. Integration**

1. **Connect Front-End to Back-End**
    
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to:
        - Fetch the current user profile data from `/api/user/profile`.
        - Submit the updated data to `/api/user/update-profile`.
2. **Handle Responses**
    
    - On success: Display a success message and update the UI.
    - On failure: Display error messages to the user.

---

#### **4. Database Adjustments**

1. **Ensure Updatable Fields**
    
    - Verify that the database schema supports updates for the following:
        - Name
        - Phone number
        - Email (if allowed)
        - Password (if applicable)
2. **Add Audit Fields (Optional)**
    
    - Include fields such as `UpdatedAt` and `UpdatedBy` to track changes.

---

#### **5. Security Considerations**

1. **Authentication**
    
    - Require a valid token for all profile update requests.
2. **Input Validation**
    
    - Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks.
3. **Secure Password Handling**
    
    - Use bcrypt or another secure hashing algorithm for password updates.
    - Never send or store passwords in plain text.
4. **Rate-Limit Requests**
    
    - Prevent abuse by rate-limiting profile update requests.
5. **Email Validation (Optional)**
    
    - If the email can be updated, require confirmation before applying the change.

---

#### **6. Testing**

1. **Unit Testing (Back-End)**
    
    - Test the `/api/user/profile` endpoint for:
        - Successful retrieval of profile data.
        - Handling unauthorized requests.
    - Test the `/api/user/update-profile` endpoint for:
        - Valid updates.
        - Invalid inputs (e.g., empty fields, duplicate email).
        - Unauthorized access.
2. **Integration Testing**
    
    - Test the full flow of fetching, editing, and saving user profile data.
3. **UI Testing**
    
    - Verify the profile update form for:
        - Correct pre-filled data.
        - Accurate validation of inputs.
        - Proper feedback messages for success and failure.
4. **Load Testing**
    
    - Test the system’s ability to handle multiple concurrent profile update requests.

---

#### **7. Deployment**

1. **Deploy Back-End Endpoints**
    
    - Ensure `/api/user/profile` and `/api/user/update-profile` are live and secure.
2. **Deploy Front-End Profile Update Page**
    
    - Include the profile update functionality in the deployed front-end application.
3. **Monitor Usage**
    
    - Track the frequency of profile updates and monitor for any suspicious activity.
