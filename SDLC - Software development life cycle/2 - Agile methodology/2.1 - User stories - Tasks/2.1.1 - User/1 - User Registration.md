- **As a user**,  
    I want to create an account with my name, email, password, and phone number,  
    so that I can access the platform and make reservations.  
    
    **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The system should provide a registration form with fields for name, email, password, and phone number.
    - The system should validate that the email is in a proper format and the password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
    - After successful registration, the user should receive a confirmation email.

### **Tasks for User Registration**

#### **1. Front-End Implementation**

1. **Create the Registration Form Component**
    
    - Design and develop a React component for the registration form.
    - The fields, texts and buttons will be in accordance with the Back-end.
2. **Implement Client-Side Validation**
    
    - Validate email format using regular expressions.
    - Ensure password meets complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, uppercase, number, special character).
    - Validate phone number format (e.g., 10-15 digits, no invalid characters).
    - Display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
3. **Show Feedback to the User**
    
    - Add a loading spinner or animation when the form is submitted.
    - Display success or error messages based on the server response.
4. **Navigation After Successful Registration**
    
    - Redirect the user to the login page or their profile page after successful registration.

#### **2. Back-End Implementation**

1. **Create Registration API Endpoint**
    
    - Develop a C# endpoint (e.g., `/api/register`) in ASP.NET Core to handle user registration.
    - The inputs will be inserted according to the design in Figma.
2. **Validate Input on the Server-Side**
    
    - Check for missing or invalid fields in the request.
    - Ensure the email is unique in the database.
    - Validate password complexity if not handled on the front-end.
3. **Hash the User Password**
    
    - Use a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash the password before saving it to the database.
4. **Save User Data to the Database**
    
    - Store the user details (name, email, hashed password, and phone number) in the database.
    - Ensure the database table includes the following fields:
        - `UserID` (Primary Key)
        - `Name`
        - `Email` (Unique)
        - `PasswordHash`
        - `PhoneNumber`
        - `CreatedAt` (Timestamp)
        - `CreatedBy`
1. **Send a Confirmation Email (Optional)**
    
    - Generate a unique confirmation token.
    - Send an email with a confirmation link to verify the user's account.

---

#### **3. Integration**

1. **Connect Front-End to Back-End**
    
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to send form data to the `/api/register` endpoint.
    - Handle server responses (success or error) and update the front-end accordingly.
2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
    
    - Display specific error messages for:
        - Duplicate email (e.g., "This email is already registered").
        - Validation errors from the server (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters").

---

#### **4. Security Considerations**

1. **Use HTTPS for Communication**
    
    - Ensure all requests and responses between the front-end and back-end are encrypted.
2. **Rate Limit Registration Requests**
    
    - Implement rate-limiting to prevent abuse of the registration endpoint.
3. **Prevent SQL Injection**
    
    - Use parameterized queries or ORM (e.g., Entity Framework) to interact with the database.

---

#### **5. Testing**

1. **Unit Testing (Back-End)**
    
    - Test the registration endpoint with various inputs:
        - Valid registration data.
        - Missing fields (e.g., no email or password).
        - Duplicate email.
2. **Integration Testing**
    
    - Verify the flow between the front-end and back-end:
        - Successful registration.
        - Error handling for invalid inputs.
3. **UI Testing**
    
    - Ensure the registration form behaves correctly:
        - Validates inputs.
        - Shows proper error and success messages.
        - Redirects the user after successful registration.
4. **Load Testing**
    
    - Test the systemâ€™s ability to handle multiple concurrent registration requests.

---

#### **6. Deployment**

1. **Deploy API Endpoint**
    
    - Ensure the `/api/register` endpoint is deployed and accessible from the front-end.
2. **Update Front-End Build**
    
    - Include the registration form in the deployed front-end application.
3. **Monitor Registration Metrics**
    
    - Track the number of successful and failed registration attempts.
