- **Description**: The user wants to register on the platform to access features such as viewing their reservations and making new hotel bookings.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1. The system should provide a registration form with fields: full name, email, password, and password confirmation.
    2. The system should validate password strength (minimum 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
    3. The user should receive a confirmation email to activate their account after registration.
    4. If the email is already registered, the system should display an error message indicating that the email is already in use.

### **Tasks:**

1. **Design the Registration Form UI**
    
    - Create a registration form with the following fields:
        - Full Name
        - Email
        - Password
        - Confirm Password
    - Add a submit button for account creation.
    - Include form labels and placeholders for better UX.
2. **Implement Front-End Form Validation**
    
    - Ensure all fields are required.
    - Validate that the password meets the security criteria (minimum 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
    - Check that the "Confirm Password" field matches the password.
3. **Connect the Registration Form to Back-End API**
    
    - Create a POST request to send the user data (name, email, password) to the back-end.
    - Display appropriate success or error messages based on the response from the server.
4. **Set Up User Registration Logic on the Back-End**
    
    - Implement an API route for user registration.
    - Hash and securely store the user’s password in the database.
    - Verify that the email is not already registered; if it is, return an appropriate error message.
5. **Send Account Activation Email**
    
    - Implement functionality to send a confirmation email after registration.
    - Include a unique activation link in the email that allows the user to verify their email address.
    - Create a confirmation page that users are redirected to after clicking the link.
6. **Implement Email Activation Logic**
    
    - Create an API route to handle the email confirmation.
    - Update the user’s account status to "active" after successful email verification.
7. **Write Unit and Integration Tests**
    
    - Write unit tests to ensure the registration logic works as expected (valid input, email uniqueness, password hashing).
    - Write integration tests to ensure the registration flow from the front-end to back-end works properly.
8. **Add Client-Side Feedback and UX Improvements**
    
    - Display success feedback on registration form submission (e.g., “Account created! Please check your email for a confirmation link.”).
    - Show validation errors next to each field (e.g., “Password must be at least 8 characters”).
