#### **Objectives of Prototyping**

1. **Validate the User Experience (UX)**: Ensure that interaction flows, such as searching and booking hotels, are simple and intuitive.

2. **Evaluate the User Interface (UI)**: Define the visual appearance and layout of elements like buttons, forms, and tables to ensure clarity and visual appeal.

3. **Test Essential Features**: Create a functional prototype that simulates key processes of the platform, such as hotel searches, viewing hotel details, and making reservations.

#### **Prototyping Process**

##### **Wireframes**

**Wireframes** are basic, low-fidelity representations of the interface, focusing primarily on structure and layout. They help define the layout and core components of the application before considering visual design.

**Recommended Tools for Wireframes**:

- **Balsamiq**: A simple and intuitive wireframing tool.

- **Figma**: Can be used to create wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes.

- **Sketch**: A design tool focused on creating wireframes and layouts.

**Steps to create wireframes**:

1. **Define the structure of each page**:
    
    - **Home page**: Should include a search bar, hotel filters, and a list of hotels with images, descriptions, and action buttons ("Book" and "View details").

    - **Hotel details page**: Displays detailed information about the hotel (description, photos, available rooms, prices) and a "Book" button.

    - **Booking page**: Includes forms for entering personal information, check-in and check-out dates, and a booking summary.

    - **Login page**: For user authentication, with fields for email/password and social login options.

2. **Map out navigation flows**:
    
    - **Unauthenticated user**: Can access the homepage, search hotels, view details, and make a booking, being redirected to the login page if necessary.

    - **Authenticated user**: Can complete the booking more quickly with prefilled profile information.

**Wireframe example for the homepage**:

- Navigation bar at the top with login/register options.

- Hotel search bar (destination, check-in/out date, number of guests).

- List of hotels displayed in cards (with images, name, location, and details button).

##### **Mockups**

**Mockups** are more detailed versions of wireframes, incorporating colors, typography, icons, and other visual design elements. They help visualize how the application will look to the end user.

**Recommended Tools for Mockups**:

- **Figma**: Excellent for collaborative designs and quick adjustments.

- **Adobe XD**: Another robust option for visual design and prototyping.

**Design visual elements**:

1. **Color scheme**: Ensure the colors align with the brandâ€™s identity and create a pleasant experience. Neutral colors can be used for backgrounds, while vibrant colors highlight buttons and calls to action.

2. **Typography**: Choose fonts that are legible and appropriate for the target audience. A serif font for titles and a sans-serif font for the body text works well in most cases.

3. **Images**: Hotel and room images are essential, so they should be high quality and optimized for the web.

4. **Interactive elements**: Buttons, form fields, navigation icons, and visual feedback (e.g., hover and focus states for buttons).

**Mockup example for the hotel details page**:

- **Header**: Hotel name prominently displayed with a hero image of the hotel in the background.

- **Details section**: Photos of the hotel, a brief description, location on a map, and amenities information.

- **Available rooms**: A list of rooms with prices, images, and booking buttons.

- **Call-to-action**: "Book now" button fixed at the bottom of the screen.

##### **Interactive Prototype**

An **interactive prototype** is a navigable version of the mockup that simulates user interaction with the system. While not yet functional, it allows for testing the user experience and identifying improvements before full development begins.

**Recommended Tools for Prototyping**:

- **Figma**: Allows for creating interactions and transitions between screens easily.

- **InVision**: A tool specifically for building interactive prototypes and simulating navigation flows.

- **Marvel**: A simple tool for quick and effective prototyping.

**Steps to create an interactive prototype**:

1. **Create transitions between pages**: For example, clicking the "View Details" button on a hotel card redirects the user to the hotel's details page.

2. **Simulate user interactions**: Interaction with booking buttons, form submissions, and success/error messages for bookings.

3. **Test the complete flow**: Navigate through key features, from searching for hotels to simulating a booking. This ensures the prototype covers all major flows:

    - Hotel search.
    - Viewing hotel details.
    - Booking a room.
    - Logging in and completing the booking.

#### **Prototyping Tests**

Once the prototype is created, it's essential to conduct **usability tests**. Feedback from users will be crucial to adjust the design and experience before full development.

1. **Testing with real users**:
    
    - Invite people from your target audience (potential customers) to use the prototype.
    - Observe how they navigate through the application, noting any points of confusion or frustration.
    - Record the time it takes to complete tasks, such as booking a room or finding a specific hotel.

2. **Iterating based on feedback**:
    
    - After testing, adjust the prototype based on the feedback received. This may include layout changes, simplifying forms, tweaking navigation, etc.
