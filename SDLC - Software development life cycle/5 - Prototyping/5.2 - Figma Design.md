### **1. Setting Up the Project in Figma**

1. **Create a New File:**
    
    - Open Figma and create a new file for your project.
    - Name it something like **EasyHotel - Registration and Authentication**.
2. **Set the Canvas:**
    
    - Define frames for each page (e.g., 1440px width for desktops or 375px width for mobile).
3. **Define a Design System (Optional but Recommended):**
    
    - Create a library for:
        - Colors (primary, secondary, error, success).
        - Typography (headings, body text, buttons).
        - Buttons and input fields as reusable components.

### **3. Mockups**

#### **What Are Mockups?**

Mockups are high-fidelity designs that include colors, fonts, images, and branding elements.

#### **Steps to Create Mockups in Figma:**

1. **Apply Your Design System:**
    
    - Use your defined color palette for buttons, inputs, and backgrounds.
    - Apply typography styles for headings and body text.
2. **Add Branding:**
    
    - Include your logo in the header or page title area.
    - Use a branded button style for primary actions (e.g., _Register_ and _Login_).
3. **Enhance Input Fields:**
    
    - Add icons (e.g., envelope for email, lock for password) inside or beside input fields.
    - Use subtle shadows and rounded corners for modern styling.
4. **Include Feedback States:**
    
    - Add error messages and success notifications.
    - Use tooltips or inline hints for invalid inputs.
5. **Responsive Design:**
    
    - Duplicate frames to show how the design adapts for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

### **4. Exporting and Sharing**

1. **Prototype the Flow:**
    
    - Link the pages in Figma using the Prototype feature to simulate navigation.
2. **Export Wireframes and Mockups:**
    
    - Export designs as PNG or PDF for sharing with stakeholders or developers.
3. **Create a Style Guide:**
    
    - Include color codes, typography specs, and component dimensions in a shared Figma file.
