#### **Overall Architecture**

The proposed architecture for the hotel reservation platform will follow a **Client-Server** model, where the front-end (React) will handle the user interface and communicate with the back-end (C# .NET Core). The back-end will manage business logic, data persistence, and integration with third-party services (such as payment gateways). The application will be divided into distinct layers, each with a clear responsibility.

#### **Architecture Layers**

1. ##### **Presentation Layer (Front-End - React)**

	This layer will be responsible for interacting with users. **React** will be used to create an interactive and responsive interface, while UI libraries like **Bootstrap** or **Material UI** will help style the components.

	- **Key components**: The UI will be divided into reusable components (e.g., buttons, reservation form, pricing table).
	
	- **Navigation**: **React Router** will handle navigation between pages, such as hotel listings, hotel details, and reservations.
	
	- **State Management**: **Context API** or **Redux** will manage the application’s state, making important data (like reservation cart or user info) accessible throughout the app.
	
	- **API Communication**: **Axios** will be used to make HTTP requests to the back-end and dynamically update the UI based on API responses.

2. ##### **Business Logic Layer (Back-End - C# .NET Core)**

	The back-end will be developed using **C# and .NET Core**, handling business logic and exposing REST APIs. It will process client requests, validate data, and interact with the database.
	
	- **REST APIs**: Controllers will expose the core functionality of the app, such as listing hotels, fetching room details, and creating reservations.
	    
	    - Example of endpoints:
	        - `GET /api/hotels`: List available hotels.
	        - `GET /api/hotels/{id}`: Get details of a specific hotel.
	        - `POST /api/reservations`: Create a new reservation.
	
	- **Business logic**: All business rules, such as checking room availability and calculating total reservation costs, will be implemented in this layer.
	    
	- **Authentication and Authorization**: Authentication will be based on **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. The system will support login for both customers and administrators, providing tokens that validate subsequent requests.
	    
	- **Third-Party Integrations**: The back-end will also handle integration with **payment gateways** (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), securely processing payments and storing transaction information.
    

3. ##### **Persistence Layer (Database - SQL Server)**

	The database will be responsible for storing and retrieving application data. We will use a relational database like **SQL Server** to store information about hotels, rooms, reservations, and users.
	
	- **Data Modeling**: The database will be structured with normalized tables, each representing an important system entity:
	    
	    - **Hotels**: Table containing hotel information (name, location, description).
	    - **Rooms**: Linked to hotels, storing details about rooms such as type, price, and availability.
	    - **Reservations**: Records of user reservations, including check-in and check-out dates.
	    - **Users**: Table to manage user accounts (both customers and administrators).
	
	- **ORM (Entity Framework)**: **Entity Framework Core** will be used as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to map C# models directly to database tables, simplifying data access and manipulation.
    

#### **Architectural Pattern (MVC)**

1. In the back-end, the architecture will follow the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

	- **Model**: Represents the entities and logic for data access (ORM using Entity Framework). For example, the models for hotel, room, reservation, and user.
	
	- **View**: Since we're working with REST APIs, a traditional "view" won’t be needed, but the data returned by the API serves as the "view" consumed by the front-end.
	
	- **Controller**: Controllers will handle HTTP requests, interact with the model, and return appropriate responses. Each main entity (hotel, room, reservation, user) will have its own controller.

#### **Security Considerations**

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
    
    - A JWT-based authentication system will be implemented, with different levels of authorization (regular users and administrators).

    - Only administrators will have access to management routes (CRUD for hotels and rooms).

2. **Data Protection**:
    
    - User passwords will be encrypted using algorithms like **bcrypt** before being stored in the database.

    - Sensitive data (such as payment information) will be transmitted securely via **HTTPS**

3. **Attack Prevention**:
    
    - Input validation will be implemented to prevent SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

    - Rate limiting will be applied to prevent denial of service (DoS) attacks.

#### **Scalability and Maintainability**

1. **Horizontal Scalability**:
    
    - The back-end will be designed for **horizontal scalability**, meaning new servers can be added to handle more traffic. Using containers (Docker) or cloud services (like AWS or Azure) will help with automatic scaling.

2. **Modularity**:
    
    - The application will be developed modularly, allowing new features to be added without needing to change existing code. This includes clear separation of responsibilities between the front-end and back-end and component-based architecture in React.

3. **API Versioning**:
    
    - The back-end will support **API versioning**, allowing future updates or significant changes to be made without breaking compatibility with previous front-end versions.

#### **Technologies and Tools**

1. **Front-End**:
    
    - **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.

    - **React Router**: For navigation between different pages.

    - **Axios**: HTTP client to consume REST APIs.

    - **Bootstrap** or **Material UI**: For styling components and responsiveness.

2. **Back-End**:
    
    - **C# .NET Core**: Robust framework to create RESTful APIs and business logic.

    - **Entity Framework Core**: ORM to facilitate database access.

    - **JWT**: For secure authentication.

    - **Stripe/PayPal SDK**: For payment integration.

3. **Database**:
    
    - **SQL Server**: Relational database to store information about hotels, rooms, reservations, and users.

4. **DevOps**:
    
    - **Docker**: To create containers, enabling consistent system execution in different environments.

    - **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Set up pipelines for continuous integration and deployment to automate testing and deployments.

    - **Cloud Hosting (AWS or Azure)**: For scalable cloud-based hosting.
